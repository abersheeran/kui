# Kuí

Kuí is an easy-to-use lightweight Python web framework.

- Routing based on compressed prefix tree
- Highly accurate type hints for better IDE support
- Route middleware that can be applied to route groups
- Dependency injection for middleware and views
- Visual API interface and online debugging

Kuí supports both [WSGI](/wsgi/) and [ASGI](/asgi/) modes, with similar usage patterns for both.
